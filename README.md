Task 1- For task 1, I used the dataset ml-latest-small which consists of the files links.csv, movies.csv, ratings.csv, and tags.csv. I then used my search engine to search for a way to select a column from a CSV file using PuTTY. I decided to use the curl command in order to get my data. In order to extract my data, I had to unzip the file. Next, I used the head command to read the first 10 lines in CSV. Then I took the second column that had the Movie IDS. The next command I used was the cat command to concatenate the file and print on the standard output. Then I searched how to sort. Then I used the sort command to reverse the output. Then I used the head command to show the columns being manipulated. 
Task 2- For task 2, I used the nano command to complete the task. Nano was already pre-installed making it easier to complete the task. I also researched shortcuts that can help me with the nano command. 
Task 3- For task 3, I used ImageMagick. I used the curl command to get my pictures in the right format for the GIF. I decided to create an anime GIF. I also used the cat command to concatenate the images. Then I set a loop.
